# Random-File
Help me to choose a movie in the folder when I don't know which one to watch (Because there are too many movies!).

Runs on terminal. Adjust the shebang appropriately (to your python interpreter) before running.

Takes one argument: the path to the directory whose a random file you want to select from.

# Example, this prints out a random file/directory in my desktop:
---
~ $ selectR.py /Users/me/Desktop
---
